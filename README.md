The White Box Project is a project that introduces many ways to solve the part of the black box of machine learning. This project is based on [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar [1]. I recommend you to read the book first and practice this project. If you are R user, you can see R code used in examples [here](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book).

# Conda
conda install -c conda-forge Skater
```

```python
import skater
```


### PDPbox

python partial dependence plot toolbox

This repository is inspired by ICEbox. The goal is to visualize the impact of certain features towards model prediction for any supervised learning algorithm using partial dependence plots [R1](https://pdpbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/papers.html#r1) [R2](https://pdpbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/papers.html#r2). PDPbox now supports all scikit-learn algorithms.

Documentation : https://pdpbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#
Github Repository : https://github.com/SauceCat/PDPbox

Installation : 

```bash
# Pip
pip install pdpbox
```

```python
import pdpbox
```


### LIME

This project is about explaining what machine learning classifiers (or models) are doing. At the moment, we support explaining individual predictions for text classifiers or classifiers that act on tables (numpy arrays of numerical or categorical data) or images, with a package called lime (short for local interpretable model-agnostic explanations). Lime is based on the work presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) ([bibtex here for citation](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime/blob/master/citation.bib)).

Documentation : https://lime-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
Github Repository : https://github.com/marcotcr/lime

Installation : 

```bash
# Pip
pip install lime
```

```python
import lime
```


### PyCEbox

A Python implementation of individual conditional expecation plots inspired by R's [ICEbox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICEbox/index.html). Individual conditional expectation plots were introduced in Peeking Inside the Black Box: Visualizing Statistical Learning with Plots of Individual Conditional Expectation ([arXiv:1309.6392](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6392)).

Documentation : http://austinrochford.github.io/PyCEbox/docs/

Installation :

```bash

```

### skope-rules

Skope-rules is a Python machine learning module built on top of scikit-learn and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

Skope-rules aims at learning logical, interpretable rules for "scoping" a target class, i.e. detecting with high precision instances of this class.

Skope-rules is a trade off between the interpretability of a Decision Tree and the modelization power of a Random Forest.

International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017.

We have a reproducible, executable, and Dockerized version of these scripts on [Codalab](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0x2b314dc3536b482dbba02783a24719fd/).

The datasets for the experiments can also be found at the Codalab link.

### shap

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions (see [papers](https://github.com/slundberg/shap#citations) for details and citations).
